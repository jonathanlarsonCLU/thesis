# INTERPRETATION: The columns Error and DecisionError show the final results of the consistency check. In this example, Error is TRUE, which means that the reported p-value is inconsistent with the reported test statistic and degrees of freedom. You can also see this in the output, where the reported p-value is "< .05", whereas the computed p-value is .0557. This also means that  DecisionError is also TRUE, which indicates not only that the reported p-value is inconsistent, but it also changes the statistical conclusion: the reported p-value is significant, whereas the recomputed one is not.Note that a result can only be a  DecisionError when it is also an Error.

# RESULTS: Only 2 of the 17 studies revealed data, this is because of the lack of structure and presentation of statistics throughout the articles (use of tables, no df in reported statistic, etc). Therefore, all statistics were inputed manually below.

# Results: Of the 6 reviewed studies, study9: Long et al., (2011) was the only one with statistical errors of reporting. This however may be due the fact all of the p-values were reported with p < .05 or p < .01. Therefore, given that only 1 error was found in the remaining 5 reviewed studies, preliminary evidence suggests that there were no signficant errors in reporting.
